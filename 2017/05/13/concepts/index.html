        <p><strong><em>Deployment</em></strong>: In theseus <code>deployment</code> is the template in which you can control how many containers you want to deploy, where to pull image for each container, and which volume you want to mount to your container.<br><strong><em>Pod</em></strong>: The instance of <code>deployment</code>. It has three status: running, waiting and terminated. A deployment may have more than one pods, each pod can be treated as a logical host which has an unique internal ip address. Pod’s structure is the same as the deployment which it born from.<br>The relation between <code>deployment</code> and <code>pod</code> looks like this:<br><img src="/images/deployment-pod-relation.png" alt="relation between deployment and pods"><br><strong><em>Volume</em></strong>: There are two main uses for the volume: data persistence and data sharing. There are two kinds of volumes: persistant volume and empty-dir volume. The difference between them is that the persistant volume is always exists unless user delete them manually, while the empty-dir volume never live longer than the pod it attached to. And the persistant volume can share data cross both containers and pods while empty-dir volume can only share data cross containers in the same pod. Here is a comparison between them:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>volume</th>
<th>persistant volume</th>
<th>Empty Directory volume</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>life</td>
<td>forever</td>
<td>in the pod</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>name</td>
<td>can named by user</td>
<td>empty-dir-*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>backend</td>
<td>NFS</td>
<td>host local storage</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>speed</td>
<td>slow</td>
<td>fast</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>cross container</td>
<td>yes</td>
<td>yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>cross pod</td>
<td>yes</td>
<td>no</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong><em>Service</em></strong>: Service in theseus is used for service discovery and load balancing. For service discovery example, image you have two deployment A and B, they works together and need know each other’s ip address before running(think about etcd), the problem is that the deployment doesn’t have ip before the deployment instantiating. So a more easy way is to let them communicate by service instead of ip since service can be controled by user while ip can not. The service can proxy any TCP/UDP package to target deployment’s instance(aka. pod). It works like this:<br><img src="/images/pods-communicate-by-service.png" alt="etcd example"><br><strong><em>Ingress</em></strong>: By service, you can find your deployment within theseus, but if you want to access your service from the internet, you should use an ingress. Ingress can map a domain to a service in theseus, then you can access the domain with browser. Ingress support both http and https.</p>
