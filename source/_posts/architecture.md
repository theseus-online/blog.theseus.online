#### The Proxy
The proxy is a reverse proxy, it has two missions:
- proxy request to appropriate backend by different url.
- check if a request has validate cookie(signature) if it's dest backend is `api`.

#### The Auth
The auth module's work is simple:
- when user request for login, it redirect user to github oauth page.
- when github redirect user back to callback url, it request github for user information, then it set cookie with user information and signature it. Besidesï¼Œ it should update user information to database(aka postgres).
- when user request for logout, it erase cookie.

#### The Api
The api's work contains two aspects:
- Map user request to k8s format, and proxy it to k8s api.
- Manage persistant volumes.

##### K8S Api Map
Theseus api will map and proxy deployment, service and ingress request to k8s, so that the frontend don't need know if the backend is k8s or not.

##### Volume Management
User can mount two kinds of volumes to container: persistant volume and `Empty Directory` volume. The difference between them is that the persistant volume is always exists unless user delete them manually, but the `Empty Directory` volume never live longer than the deployment it attached to, in other words, when you create or update deployment, there is no way to choise a `Empty Directory` volume created before.  
Here is a compare between `Empty Directory` volume and persistant volume:

| volume  | persistant volume | Empty Directory volume |
|---------|-------------------|------------------------|
| life    | forever           | in the deployment      |
| name    | can named by user | empty-dir-*            |
| backend | NFS               | host local storage     |
| speed   | slow              | fast                   |

#### The Portal
The portal is the user interface, served as static files(html, js, css etc.).
