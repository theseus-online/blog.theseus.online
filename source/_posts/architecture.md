#### The Proxy
The proxy is a reverse proxy, it has two missions:
- proxy request to appropriate backend by different url.
- check if a request has validate cookie(signature) if it's target backend is `api`.

#### The Auth
The auth module's work is simple:
- when user request for login, it redirect user to github oauth page.
- when github redirect user back to callback url, it request github for user information, then it set cookie with user information and signature it. Besidesï¼Œ it should update user information to database(aka postgres).
- when user request for logout, it erase cookie.

#### The Api
The api's work contains two aspects:
- Map user request to k8s format, and proxy it to k8s api.
- Manage persistent volumes.

#### The Portal
The portal is the user interface, served as static files(html, js, css etc.).
